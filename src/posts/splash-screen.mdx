## Steps to Add a Launch Screen:

**1. Create a New Storyboard File:**

- Right-click on your project and select New File.
- Choose Storyboard and name it LaunchScreen.storyboard.

**2. Design the Launch Screen:**

- Open LaunchScreen.storyboard.
- Drag in UI elements like an image or label that represents your app's logo or name.
- Make sure to keep the design simple and aligned with your brand.

**3. Set the Launch Screen in Xcode:**

- In the Project Navigator, go to the root of your project.
- Under the **General** tab, scroll to the **App Icons and Launch Images section**.
- In the **Launch Screen** File field, type LaunchScreen (or select it from the dropdown).

**4. Test Your Launch Screen:**

- Run your app on a simulator or device, and you’ll see the launch screen appear before transitioning to your app’s main view.
